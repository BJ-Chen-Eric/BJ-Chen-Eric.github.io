Bo-Jia Chen, Eric, is trained as a bioinformatician experting in transcriotome and Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data analysis. Having experience in Nanopore, the third generation sequencing (TGS), single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and Spatial transcriptomics (ST). As inroll in epidemiology institute, the study design in epidemiology deeply influence me when doing the researches. I have done several projects including virus transcriptome, virus genome and phylogentics and host transcriptome reaction in virus infection. 
Walking to the end of Ph.D journey, I have to specificaly thanks two teachers, [Dr. Day-Yu Chao](https://dyclab-nchu.github.io) and [Dr. James J Cai](https://cailab-tamu.github.io). Dr.Chao give me a hand when I was lost in the biological field, reposition me to the dry lab work and keeping pushing me culturing the independent thinking capability. I respect your think reflexibility and unfearness in any studies. Dr. Cai lead me into the scRNA-seq world and fully support me chasing any oppotunities in the USA. I respect your working activity in any project and facing students.
