1. Infectivity
    - Definition: The capability pathogen **establish the infection** in the host. Measuring how easy the pathogen enter, survive and replication in the host.
    - Key: Often refers to the minimum infectious dose. The minimum requirement of a pathogen cause infection in a host
2. Pathogenicity
    - Definition: The capability pathogen **cause disease (symptoms)** in the host. Measuring how easy the pathogen lead to the symptoms.
    - Key: Whether the symptoms after infection but **not refers to the severity**
3. Virulence
    - Definition: The capability pathogen **cause severe symptoms** in the host. Measuring how harmful the pathogen affect the host and the disease severity.
