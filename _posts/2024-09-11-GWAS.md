### Study Notes: Genomics and Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS)
(Manual Note)['/note/GWAS_note.pdf']

**1. Human Genome Overview**  
- The human genome consists of approximately 3 billion base pairs of DNA organized into 23 chromosomes.
- During cell division (meiosis), chromosomes undergo condensation, recombination, and segregation across two phases: Meiosis I and Meiosis II.
- The process ensures genetic variation across generations.

**2. Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs)**  
- SNPs are DNA sequence variations where a single nucleotide (A, T, C, or G) differs between individuals.
- Key terms:
  - **Locus**: A specific location in the genome.
  - **Variant**: A genetic difference compared to the human reference genome.
  - **Polymorphism**: A variant common in the population (over 1%).
  - **Allele**: Identity of genetic variation at a locus.
  - **Genotype**: Combination of alleles at a locus in an individual.
  - **Heterozygous**: Different alleles at a locus.
  - **Homozygous**: Same allele at a locus.

**3. Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE)**  
- HWE occurs when genotype frequencies remain constant across generations, provided there is no mutation, migration, natural selection, or assortative mating.
- HWE can be tested using a chi-square test, comparing observed genotype frequencies with expected values.
- Example: Phenylketonuria (PKU), where the disease frequency (qÂ²) is 1 in 10,000 newborns, yielding a carrier frequency of 2%.

**4. Linkage Disequilibrium (LD)**  
- LD is the non-random association of alleles at two or more loci.
- Important for identifying genetic correlations and understanding disease risks.

**5. Population Structure in GWAS**  
- Cases and controls must be ethnically matched to avoid population stratification, which could lead to false associations.
- Using ancestry-informative markers is key to adjusting for population structure.

**6. GWAS Overview**  
- GWAS investigates associations between genotype (genetic variation) and phenotype (observable traits).
- It scans genetic markers across many individuals to find variations linked to specific traits or diseases.
- Key advances: 
  - Early studies focused on rare, monogenic diseases.
  - More recent studies incorporate common diseases and traits, utilizing resources like the Human Genome Project and HapMap.

**7. Hypothesis Testing in GWAS**  
- Phase I: Hypothesis generation or exploratory genome-wide scans.
- Phase II: Hypothesis testing, involving candidate gene/region scans.

**8. Type I and Type II Errors in GWAS**  
- **Type I error**: False positive, guarded against by specifying a priori hypotheses and statistical adjustments (e.g., Bonferroni correction).
- **Type II error**: False negative, reduced by increasing sample size and performing meta-analyses.

**9. Mendelian Randomization (MR)**  
- MR uses genetic variants as instruments to estimate the causal effect of a modifiable exposure on disease.
- It requires the genetic variant to be associated with the exposure but not with confounders.

**10. Genetic Risk Score (GRS) and GxE Interactions**  
- GRS aggregates the effect of multiple genetic variants to estimate disease risk.
- **Gene-Environment Interaction (GxE)** explores how the effect of an environmental factor on disease risk differs across genotypes.

### Example Studies in GWAS  
- **Hypertension Study**: Meta-analysis of GWAS involving over 200,000 subjects identified 29 independent loci associated with systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Many of these loci had not been previously linked to hypertension.
